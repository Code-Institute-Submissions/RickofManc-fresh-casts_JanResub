        I love podcasts. I assume you love podcasts. The problem I found is
        discoverability of new podcasts. The chances are you unearth new
        podcasts from a friend, Google or a chart within a listening app.
        These sites use a ranking system that ensures top shows
        get the most plays> This keeps them at the top of the pile,
        and it all becomes a bit stale.
